    There is a <strong>revolution happening</strong> with remote work and paying your rent.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your rent is a <strong>huge percentage</strong> of your take home pay.

    <p>
    Are you getting a good deal with your current landlord?

    <strong>six RR minimum standards</strong>?
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A common area to work, yes like a WeWork!</li>
      <li>Fellow tenants working in the same industry/company.</li>
      <li>A sense of community, neighbors know everyone.</li>
      <li>No "Leasing Agent" tours for new tenants, actual tenants show you around.</li>
      <li>Equity build up with each payment.</li>
      <li>Group meals, humans like to eat together.</li>
